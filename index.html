               <h2>Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I ended up making about 75 of these cookies over the week of the 4th of July and was disappointed that I never got the chance to take any of them home. 10/10 there will not be any leftovers.</p>
               <img src="images/chocolate-chip-cookie.webp" height="200" width="200">
               <ul>
                  <li>3/4 cup brown butter</li>
                  <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
                  <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                  <li>1 egg + 1 egg yolk</li>
                  <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                  <li>1 + 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                  <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                  <li>chocolate chips (measure with your heart)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Combine cooled brown butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar - beat with electric mixer until well combined. Mix in the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla. Mix well.</p>
               <p><s>in a separate bowl</s> I don't have time to wash the separate bowl, I'm already doing so many dishes after making these cookies. Add your salt, baking soda, and flour to the bowl and mix just enough to where everything is incorporated. Add chocolate - I use a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolates. It adds a nice texture to the cookie if it's chopped chocolate, but when it comes to making chocolate chip cookies I really think that the flavor, type of chocolate chips, and amount are completely up to the person making them. Absolutely no wrong answers. (If you really want to go for it with the chocolate, save a little to dip the top of the cookie dough ball into before baking.) </p>
               <p>Refridgerate the dough (if you have the time).</p>
               <p>Set the oven to 350F. Scoop cookies onto a parchment lined cookie sheet and bake for about 11 minutes, or until the edges of the cookie are starting to set but the middle is still pretty gooey. Let them rest on the warm cookie sheet until centers are starting to set. Optionally, sprinkle to cookies with some flaky sea salt.</p>

               <h2>Bailey's Cheesecake</h2>
               <p>Probably the smoothest cheesecake I've ever made in my life. No complaints, will be 10/10 when I make it with a brownie crust.</p>
               <ul>
                  <b>for the crust</b>
                  <li>2 + 1/4 cups crushed oreos (without the filling)</li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                  <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
                  <li>1/2 cupunsalted butter (melted)</li>
                  <b>for the cheesecake</b>
                  <li>32 oz (4 regular packages) cream cheese</li>
                  <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                  <li>4 large eggs</li>
                  <li>1/2 cup Bailey's irish cream liqour</li>
                  <b>*optionally* chocolate ganache</b>
                  <li>1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate</li>
                  <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
                  <b>*optionally* (but not really) coffee whipped cream</b>
                  <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon instant espresso powder</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Preheat oven to 325F. Combine chocolate cookie crumbs, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and butter. Pour crumb mixture into pan and press evenly around the pan. Set aside.</p>
               <p>With an electric mixer, beat together softened cream cheese with granulated sugar until just combined. Mix in eggs one at a time, thn add Bailey's. Try to avoid over-mixing and adding too much air into the mixture to keep it smooth and creamy. Pour mixture into your prepared pan and bake at 325F for 55-60 minutes (or until it is gently set at the edges but still wobbly in the middle). Turn off the oven but allow cheesecake to cool while still in the oven. Once the cheesecake is cool, refridgerate for at least 4 hours.</p>
               <p><em>Optionally,</em> for the ganache, heat the heavy cream and pour over chocolate pieces. Let sit for a few minutes, then stir to combine. Let cool slightly before pouring over top the cheesecake.</p>
               <p><em>Optionally,</em>(but truly, not really) for the coffee whipped cream, combine heavy cream, brown sugar, espresso powder, and vanilla extract. Whip with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</p>
